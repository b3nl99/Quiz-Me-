I was able to create the start button and start the quiz

but I did not have enough time to be able to create an eventlistener for the mutipule choice sections but I was able to create a timer for the quiz when it starts.
I was able to set the timer to immediately finish the quiz and make the page go to the submite page

I feel as though I did not have enough time to complete this challenge. It felt a lot more challenging due to having to interact with both HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript. 
I wish that I had more to to be able to personalize the quiz and make it more dynamuic and more user friendly.
